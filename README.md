Vernier - exploration of iBeacon-based location
=======

A small project that lets you collect RSSI samples using http server.

The iPhone app is a fork of [EstimoteSDK](https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK)
which implements very simple streaming of RSSI samples to http server.

The http server is a [Play](www.playframework.com) app.

The quality of the code found here reflects @gkossakowski's lacking iOS and Play
programming skills.
